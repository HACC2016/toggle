# Purpose: Youtube Hawaiian Policitians Now. How to connect politicians to the general voter? An always changing answer to a neverending question.

# Challenge: People are shifting away from watching Television in the box and more towards Internet TV.  The next generation of voters watch media outlets such as youtube on their mobile devices.  How are politicians adapting to such changes in voter behavior?  

# Outcome: Not very well. The most recent youtube footage from some policitians go back as far as 2011.  Hawaii's own policitians admit things go slow on the islands, but their inaction to the latest media trends results in an outdated perception to the public.

# Application Result: Create an application according to voter behavior for those moving toward mobile Internet devices. In other words, create an application for someone with a 10 second attention span, who wants the information hand-delivered to them. Hence, the objective will be to: 1) Aggregate the massive amount of data to a simple interface (creating a Google for politician actions). 2) Provide the information in 3 clicks or less. 3) Link Youtube to each politican profile.
